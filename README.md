# Hidden Hits

I created a `.gitignore` file to (1) not upload any of the `.ipynb_checkpoints` files,
and (2) to not upload a directory named `data` 
where we should keep our large data sets
because GitHub won't let us upload too large of files.

All "old" notebooks and data files are in the scraps folder.
