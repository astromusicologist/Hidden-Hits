    "- The function takes two arguments: `title` is the song's title name and `artist` is the name of the (first) artist that performed the song.\n",
    "- The function first modifies the inputs to remove all whitespaces and replace them with \"-\"s. **Note that inputs should only contain alphanumeric characters (no ',! etc).**\n",
    "- Then the function creates the Genius URL for the given song and parses it through BeautifulSoup\n",
    "- We then create 2 `div` elements that can potentially contain the lyrics. Based on my experience with Genius, the website can generate either of the two elements:\n",
    "    - `<div class='song_body-lyrics'>`\n",
    "    - `<div class='SongPageGrid-sc-1vi6xda-0 DGVcp Lyrics__Root-sc-1ynbvzw-0 kkHBOZ'>`\n",
    "- The function then checks which of the two elements exists. Finding the one that does, it then collects the text for the lyrics and formats it accordingly to generate one clean string. New lines are indicated with the '@' logo.\n",
    "- The function then returns the formatted lyrics. If no lyrics exist then it returns a string saying 'None Found'\n",
